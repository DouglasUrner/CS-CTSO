# CS CTSO

Notes towards the development of a CS focused CTSO for CTE classes in the US.

## Mission

***To promote the understanding of and engagement in computer science related pathways through activies related to game design and development and the related arts and techologies.***

The mission statement should be broad enough to (at least) include modedling and simulation in general (i.e., IB CS) and other uses of game related technowlogies - e.g., game engines in architectural rendering and VR/AR simulation.

It would also be good if the mission could encompass cross-disciplinary programs/projects such as the PCSC's game console project.

Since some schools use game design as a gateway to a broader CS pathway, crafting the mission statement so that these programs could participate even as their CS focus expands would be good. It might be eough to assert that game development is all encompassing (or at least capable of supporting) and to allow for the possibility of including other specialties, such as hardware focused or web focused programs.
